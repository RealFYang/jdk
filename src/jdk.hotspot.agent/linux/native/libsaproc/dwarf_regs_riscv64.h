 *       DWARF register number encodings
 *
 * DWARF registers 1 - 31 correspond to integer registers x1 - x31 (DWARF
 * register 0 would be x0/zero, which never appears in call frame
 * instructions). These numbers are identical to the register indices in
 * RISCV64ThreadContext, where index 0 is pc instead (pc has no DWARF
 * register number; the return address register is x1/ra).
